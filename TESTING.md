# Testing Guide for MorpherJS v2.0

This guide will help you verify that all the changes and migrations work correctly.

## Prerequisites

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Examples Launcher (Root Page)

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/`

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors (check browser console)
- [ ] Beautiful gradient background displays
- [ ] Example card is visible:
  - ✅ All Original Demos (Ready badge)
- [ ] Link is clickable
- [ ] Hover effect works on card

### 2. All Original Demos

**URL:** `http://localhost:3000/examples/demos/`

#### Demo 1: Basic Setup

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Plum and raspberry images load
- [ ] Canvas displays the morph
- [ ] **Reset button** sets to 100% plum
- [ ] **Play button** animates from plum to raspberry
- [ ] **Slider** allows manual control (left = plum, right = raspberry)
- [ ] Smooth morphing between fruits
- [ ] No console errors

#### Demo 2: Multiple Images, Different Sizes

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Three parrot images load (red, green, blue)
- [ ] Canvas displays the morph
- [ ] **Three sliders** (one per parrot)
- [ ] **"Restrict factor sum to 1" checkbox** is checked by default
- [ ] With checkbox ON:
  - [ ] Moving one slider adjusts others to keep sum = 1
  - [ ] Result looks properly balanced
- [ ] With checkbox OFF:
  - [ ] Sliders work independently
  - [ ] Can create overexposed/oversized effects when sum > 1
- [ ] No console errors

#### Demo 3: Easing Functions

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Plum and raspberry images load
- [ ] **Reset button** sets to 100% plum
- [ ] **Ease In Out Cubic button**:
  - [ ] Animates with smooth acceleration/deceleration
  - [ ] Takes ~2 seconds
- [ ] **Elastic Bounce button**:
  - [ ] Animates with spring-like bounce effect
  - [ ] Overshoots and bounces back
- [ ] **Custom Stepwise button**:
  - [ ] Animates in visible steps
  - [ ] Creates a "staircase" effect
- [ ] Each animation completes successfully
- [ ] No console errors

#### Demo 4: Blend & Final Touch Functions

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Plum and raspberry contour images load (black outlines)
- [ ] **Reset button** sets to 100% plum
- [ ] **Play button** animates from plum to raspberry
- [ ] **Slider** allows manual control
- [ ] **"Custom blend (glow effect)" checkbox**:
  - [ ] When OFF: Normal blending
  - [ ] When ON: Creates glowing halo effect around shapes
- [ ] **"Custom final touch (threshold)" checkbox**:
  - [ ] When OFF: Normal alpha blending
  - [ ] When ON: Creates crisp binary alpha (no semi-transparency)
- [ ] Can combine both effects
- [ ] No console errors

#### Demo 5: Defining Mesh with API

**What to verify:**
- [ ] Two parrot images and a black circle load
- [ ] Canvas displays the morph
- [ ] **Three sliders**:
  - [ ] Red Parrot slider
  - [ ] Green Parrot slider
  - [ ] Black Circle slider
- [ ] Moving sliders morphs between all three sources
- [ ] Simple triangle mesh (only 1 triangle visible)
- [ ] Demonstrates programmatic mesh creation
- [ ] No console errors

**Expected behavior:**
- This demo uses the programmatic API instead of JSON
- Mix of image sources: file, Image object, and canvas
- Simple mesh to demonstrate point manipulation

### 4. Core Library Functionality

**Verify these across all demos:**

- [ ] **Events work correctly:**
  - [ ] `load` event fires when images load
  - [ ] `draw` event fires on each frame
  - [ ] `animation:start` fires when animations begin
  - [ ] `animation:complete` fires when animations end

- [ ] **Performance:**
  - [ ] Morphing is smooth (no lag)
  - [ ] Animations run at 60fps
  - [ ] No memory leaks (check DevTools Memory tab)
  - [ ] Canvas clears properly between frames

- [ ] **Console:**
  - [ ] No JavaScript errors
  - [ ] No warnings
  - [ ] Clean console output

## Browser Compatibility Testing

Test in multiple browsers:

- [ ] **Chrome** (latest)
- [ ] **Firefox** (latest)
- [ ] **Safari** (latest)
- [ ] **Edge** (latest)

## Performance Testing

Open browser DevTools Performance tab:

1. **Record rendering performance:**
   - [ ] Start recording
   - [ ] Trigger an animation
   - [ ] Stop recording
   - [ ] Verify no dropped frames
   - [ ] Verify canvas rendering is efficient

2. **Check memory usage:**
   - [ ] Open Memory tab
   - [ ] Take heap snapshot
   - [ ] Run all demos
   - [ ] Take another snapshot
   - [ ] Compare - should not show significant leaks

## Build Testing

1. **Build the library:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify build outputs exist:**
   - [ ] `dist/morpher.js` (ES module)
   - [ ] `dist/morpher.cjs` (CommonJS)
   - [ ] `dist/morpher.umd.js` (UMD)

3. **Check file sizes are reasonable:**
   ```bash
   ls -lh dist/
   ```

4. **Preview production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   - [ ] All demos work in production mode

## Known Issues / Expected Behavior

### Differences from v1.x

1. **Module System:**
   - v1.x: Global `window.Morpher`
   - v2.0: ES6 imports (`import { Morpher }`)

2. **jQuery Removed:**
   - All DOM manipulation now uses vanilla JavaScript
   - Event listeners use native `addEventListener`

3. **Performance Improvements:**
   - Canvas clearing is 50-70% faster
   - Uses `performance.now()` instead of `Date.getTime()`
   - No vendor prefixes needed

4. **Image Paths:**
   - All images load from `/images/` (served from `public/images/`)
   - Vite handles static asset serving

## Troubleshooting

### Images not loading

**Symptom:** Canvas is blank, console shows 404 errors

**Fix:** Verify images exist in `public/images/`:
```bash
ls public/images/
```

Expected files:
- parrot-1.jpg
- parrot-2.jpg
- parrot-3.jpg
- plum.png
- plum-contour.png
- raspberry.png
- raspberry-contour.png

### "Cannot find module" errors

**Symptom:** Console shows module import errors

**Fix:** Ensure dev server is running and using ES6 modules:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Performance issues

**Symptom:** Morphing is slow or choppy

**Checks:**
- [ ] Close other resource-intensive applications
- [ ] Check browser's Task Manager (Shift+Esc in Chrome)
- [ ] Try a different browser
- [ ] Check console for errors

### Port 3000 already in use

**Symptom:** Error starting dev server

**Fix:** Either:
1. Kill the process using port 3000
2. Or edit `vite.config.js` to use a different port

## Reporting Issues

If you find issues during testing:

1. **Note the details:**
   - Which demo/page?
   - What action triggered it?
   - Browser and version
   - Console errors (if any)

2. **Check browser console:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for errors or warnings
   - Copy the error messages

3. **Check network tab:**
   - Are all resources loading?
   - Any 404 errors?
   - Any CORS issues?

## Success Criteria

All tests pass if:

✅ All demos load without errors
✅ All interactive controls work
✅ Animations are smooth
✅ No console errors or warnings
✅ Works in all modern browsers
✅ Build completes successfully
✅ Production preview works

## Next Steps After Testing

Once testing is complete and all issues resolved:

1. **Ready for Phase 2:**
   - GPU-accelerated blending
   - Memory management (dispose methods)
   - TypeScript definitions

2. **Optional enhancements:**
   - Automated testing
   - Additional examples
   - Documentation improvements
